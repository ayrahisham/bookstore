							On his way back from Maine, Reacher decides to visit 
							his father’s ancestral home – a place he’d heard a lot 
							about as a kid. But the rural New Hampshire town turns out
							to be more of a mystery than a homecoming when he discovers
							no record of anyone named Reacher ever having lived there. <br><br>

							In “The Enemy” Reacher discovered his mother’s history. 
							Now he’s on a quest to find his father’s.
