						<blockquote>
							An unforgettable and sweeping family saga from MARKUS ZUSAK, 
							the storyteller who gave us the extraordinary bestseller 
							THE BOOK THIEF. <br><br>

							The breathtaking story of five brothers who bring each 
							other up in a world run by their own rules. As the 
							Dunbar boys love and fight and learn to reckon with 
							the adult world, they discover the moving secret behind 
							their father’s disappearance.<br><br>

							At the center of the Dunbar family is Clay, 
							a boy who will build a bridge – for his family, 
							for his past, for greatness, for his sins, for a miracle.<br><br>

							The question is, how far is Clay willing to go? 
							And how much can he overcome? <br><br>

							Written in powerfully inventive language and bursting 
							with heart, BRIDGE OF CLAY is signature Zusak.<br><br>
