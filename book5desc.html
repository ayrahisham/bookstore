							<b> The thrilling history of the Targaryens comes to life in this 
							masterly work by the author of A Song of Ice and Fire, 
							the inspiration for HBO’s Game of Thrones. </b><br><br>
							With all the fire and fury fans have come to expect from 
							internationally bestselling author George R. R. Martin, 
							this is the first volume of the definitive two-part history 
							of the Targaryens in Westeros. <br><br>
							Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, 
							House Targaryen – the only family of dragonlords to survive 
							the Doom of Valyria – took up residence on Dragonstone. 
							Fire and Blood begins their tale with the legendary Aegon the 
							Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount 
							the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold that iconic 
							seat, all the way up to the civil war that nearly tore their 
							dynasty apart. <br><br>
							What really happened during the Dance of the Dragons? 
							Why did it become so deadly to visit Valyria after the Doom? 
							What is the origin of Daenerys’s three dragon eggs? 
							These are but a few of the questions answered in this essential 
							chronicle, as related by a learned maester of the Citadel and 
							featuring more than eighty all-new black-and-white illustrations
							by artist Doug Wheatley. Readers have glimpsed small parts of 
							this narrative in such volumes as The World of Ice & Fire, but 
							now, for the first time, the full tapestry of Targaryen history 
							is revealed. <br><br>
							With all the scope and grandeur of Gibbon’s The History 
							of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Fire and Blood 
							is the ultimate game of thrones, giving readers a whole new 
							appreciation for the dynamic, often bloody, and always 
							fascinating history of Westeros.
