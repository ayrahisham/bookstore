						<blockquote>
							The warm fall day starts like any other at the Center – 
							a women’s reproductive health services clinic – its staff 
							offering care to anyone who passes through its doors. 
							Then, in late morning, a desperate and distraught gunman 
							bursts in and opens fire, taking all inside hostage.<br><br>

							After rushing to the scene, Hugh McElroy, a police hostage 
							negotiator, sets up a perimeter and begins making a plan to 
							communicate with the gunman. As his phone vibrates with 
							incoming text messages he glances at it and, to his horror, 
							finds out that his fifteen-year-old daughter, Wren, is 
							inside the clinic.<br><br>

							But Wren is not alone. She will share the next and tensest 
							few hours of her young life with a cast of unforgettable 
							characters: A nurse who calms her own panic in order save 
							the life of a wounded woman. A doctor who does his work not 
							in spite of his faith but because of it, and who will find 
							that faith tested as never before. A pro-life protester 
							disguised as a patient, who now stands in the cross hairs 
							of the same rage she herself has felt. A young woman who 
							has come to terminate her pregnancy. And the disturbed 
							individual himself, vowing to be heard.<br><br>

							Told in a daring and enthralling narrative structure that 
							counts backward through the hours of the standoff, this is 
							a story that traces its way back to what brought each of 
							these very different individuals to the same place on this 
							fateful day.<br><br>
