						<blockquote>
							Fifteen years ago, the world fell in love with Eddie, a grizzled war 
							veteran- turned-amusement park mechanic who died saving the life of 
							a young girl named Annie. Eddie’s journey to heaven taught him that 
							every life matters. Now, in this magical sequel, Mitch Albom reveals 
							Annie’s story. <br><br>
							The accident that killed Eddie left an indelible mark on Annie. 
							It took her left hand, which needed to be surgically reattached. 
							Injured, scarred, and unable to remember why, Annie’s life is 
							forever changed by a guilt-ravaged mother who whisks her away 
							from the world she knew. Bullied by her peers and haunted by 
							something she cannot recall, Annie struggles to find acceptance 
							as she grows. When, as a young woman, she reconnects with Paulo, 
							her childhood love, she believes she has finally found happiness. <br><br>
							As the novel opens, Annie is marrying Paulo. But when her wedding
							night day ends in an unimaginable accident, Annie finds herself 
							on her own heavenly journey – and an inevitable reunion with 
							Eddie, one of the five people who will show her how her life 
							mattered in ways she could not have fathomed. <br><br>
							Poignant and beautiful, filled with unexpected twists, 
							The Next Person You Meet in Heaven reminds us that not only 
							does every life matter, but that every ending is also a beginning
							– we only need to open our eyes to see it.
