							J.K. Rowling’s five-film Fantastic Beasts adventure series 
							continues with the original screenplay for Fantastic Beasts: 
							The Crimes of Grindelwald <br><br>
							<b>The Wizarding World journey continues . . .</b><br><br>
							The powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald was captured in 
							New York with the help of Newt Scamander. But, making good on 
							his threat, Grindelwald escapes custody and sets about gathering 
							followers, most of whom are unsuspecting of his true agenda: 
							to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical 
							beings. <br><br>
							In an effort to thwart Grindelwald’s plans, Albus Dumbledore 
							enlists Newt, his former Hogwarts student, who agrees to help 
							once again, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are 
							drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest 
							friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world. <br><br>
							Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is the second 
							screenplay in a five-film series to be written by J.K. Rowling, 
							author of the internationally bestselling Harry Potter books. 
							Set in 1927, a few months after the events of Fantastic Beasts 
							and Where To Find Them, and moving from New York to London, 
							Paris and even back to Hogwarts, this story of mystery and magic 
							reveals an extraordinary new chapter in the wizarding world. 
							Illustrated with stunning line art from MinaLima with some 
							surprising nods to the Harry Potter stories that will delight 
							fans of both the books and films.
