						<blockquote>
						The epic new novel from the internationally acclaimed and best-selling author of 1Q84.
						In Killing Commendatore, a thirty-something portrait painter in Tokyo is abandoned by 
						his wife and finds himself holed up in the mountain home of a famous artist, Tomohiko Amada. <br><br> 
						When he discovers a strange painting in the attic, he unintentionally opens a circle of mysterious circumstances. 
						To close it, he must complete a journey that involves a mysterious ringing bell, a two-foot-high physical manifestation of an Idea, 
						a dapper businessman who lives across the valley, a precocious thirteen-year-old girl, a Nazi assassination attempt during World War II in Vienna, 
						a pit in the woods behind the artist’s home, and an underworld haunted by Double Metaphors. <br><br>
						A tour de force of love and loneliness, war and art – as well as a loving homage to The Great Gatsby 
						– Killing Commendatore is a stunning work of imagination from one of our greatest writers.
