						<blockquote>
						The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho continues to change the lives of its readers forever. 
						With more than two million copies sold around the world, The Alchemist has established 
						itself as a modern classic, universally admired. <br><br>
						Paulo Coelho’s masterpiece tells the magical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd 
						boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure as extravagant as any ever found. 
						The story of the treasures Santiago finds along the way teaches us, as only a few stories 
						can, about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, learning to read the omens 
						strewn along life’s path, and, above all, following our dreams.
