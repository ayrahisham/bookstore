							<b>Critically acclaimed and bestselling authors Becky 
							Albertalli and Adam Silvera combine their talents in 
							this smart, funny, heartfelt collaboration about two 
							very different boys who can’t decide if the universe is 
							pushing them together – or pulling them apart.</b><br><br>

							ARTHUR is only in New York for the summer, but if 
							Broadway has taught him anything, it’s that the universe 
							can deliver a showstopping romance when you least expect 
							it. <br><br>

							BEN thinks the universe needs to mind its business. 
							If the universe had his back, he wouldn’t be on his 
							way to the post office carrying a box of his ex-boyfriend’s
							things. <br><br>

							But when Arthur and Ben meet-cute at the post office, 
							what exactly does the universe have in store for them…?<br><br>

							Maybe nothing. After all, they get separated.<br><br>

							Maybe everything. After all, they get reunited.<br><br>

							But what if they can’t nail a first date even after 
							three do-overs?<br><br>

							What if Arthur tries too hard to make it work and Ben 
							doesn’t try hard enough?<br><br>

							What if life really isn’t like a Broadway play?<br><br>

							But what if it is?<br><br>

							<b>What if it’s us?</b>
